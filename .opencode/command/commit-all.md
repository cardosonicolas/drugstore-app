Group all current changes into meaningful semantic commits and push the current branch.

Optional context for commit messages: $ARGUMENTS

Rules:

First inspect the full repository state:
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
git log --oneline -10
Identify related file groups by intent: feature, fix, refactor, tests, docs, chore, release, or config.
Create multiple commits when there are independent changes. Do not mix unrelated changes in the same commit.
If $ARGUMENTS is not empty, use it as context to adjust commit messages, but do not force that text if it does not accurately describe the changes.
Use clear, semantic, concise commit messages that follow the repo's recent style.
Before committing, check for sensitive or suspicious files (.env, tokens, credentials, keys, secrets). If any appear, stop and ask.
Include new, modified, and deleted files that belong to each group.
Do not revert existing changes.
Do not use --no-verify.
Do not amend commits.
Do not force push.
Flow:

Show the proposed commit plan with the files included in each commit.
If the grouping is clear, continue. If there is real ambiguity, ask before committing.
For each group:
Add only the files for that group with git add <files>.
Create the commit with a semantic message.
Once all commits have been created, run: git push
When finished, summarize the commits created and the branch that was pushed.
